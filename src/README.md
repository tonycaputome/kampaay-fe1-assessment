# Kampaay coding challenge

TEST

Welcome to the _first Kampaay coding challenge_!

You are requested to solve the quick assignments below, save your work and share the generated codesandbox link with us by mail.

- **Just `index.js` and `styles.css`** should be modified
- You can leave **comments** in your code in order to let us better understand your intentions.
- You are evaluated on your **problem solving skills**, not only on your results.
- App is supposed to be run on modern browser, so you can use modern js, css, html as long as it runs on codesandbox: **no compatibility concerns!**
- You cannot import/use any library: **just plain js**!
- You can **use any manual and/or online resource** but we strongly suggest to try to **solve it by yourself** since we will discuss and continue this test together.

## How to proceed

Just modify source files and save them (ctrl-S or Menu > File > Save): the first saving will generate a new version that you can share to anyone.

_WARNING_: remember to save your work before sharing it by mail!
We suggest to test everything is fine by opening the URL in an incognito window: if you can see your last changes, then we'll be able too ;-)

_HINTS_: preview panel on the right shows you the result of the code execution and it is updated in real time as soon as you modify it; if it does not update, just try to click the "reload" button (on the top of the panel).
You can use the console support ("Console" tab on the bottom of the panel) and you can also open developer tools as you can do with your browser for any other webpage.

# Assignments

You can see on the right (in codesandbox preview) our drink list: our colleague started working on it but he left it incomplete in styling and features.

He left 3 assignments to complete it:

## 1. Sorting

Implement drink list sorting in ASCENDING order by `price` first, then by `name`: this means that when 2 drinks have the same price, (i.e: "Old Fashioned" and "Bloody Mary" have the same price, so "Bloody Mary" should precede "Old Fashioned").

## 2. Styling

Style the drink list in order to be as similar as possible to `final.png` using flexbox.
You can target DOM elements using classes and tag names already inferred in the HTML template you can find in `index.js` (please do not update it!).

## 3. Interaction

Add a button to reverse the sorting: every time the user clicks on it the sorting should be updated from ASCENDING to DESCENDING order and vice-versa.
